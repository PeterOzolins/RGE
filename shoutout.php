Jordan and Paulette did an amazing job. All of the kids had a great time and the party was non-stop for four hours. We will certainly recommend Jordan to all of our friends. He was the best we have ever seen.

You appealed to everyone, from the youngest to the oldest and everyone in between. You got us all up and dancing without being obnoxious and annoying&mdash;just ENERGETIC and ENTHUSIASTIC. Your dancers were friendly and talented and I loved how they hugged the kids when they left.  Dealing with you and your IMMENSE PROFESSIONALISM  was a pleasure; then watching you and your team rise to top and hearing all my guests RAVE about you.  You deserve all their praise...and ours.  Can't wait until 2013!
